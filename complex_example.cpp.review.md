Overall Assessment:
The changes made to the file complex_example.cpp appear to be focused on improving readability and maintainability of the code. The diff highlights several code style issues such as a missing space before the `<<` in the line `std::cout << "Total elements: " << vec->size() << std::endl;` and using `auto` keyword for `t` in the loop.

Issues Found:
1. The typo in the variable name `total elementss` in the print statement.
2. Using `auto` keyword for `t` in the loop instead of explicitly specifying the type.
3. Missing space before the `<<` operator in the print statement.
4. Potential security vulnerability with the use of `std::out_of_range` exception being thrown from the `get()` method without proper handling.

Suggestions:
1. Correct the typo in the variable name `total elementss` to `total elements`.
2. Use explicit type for `t` instead of using `auto`.
3. Add a space before the `<<` operator in the print statement.
4. Properly handle the exception thrown from `get()` method by checking the index before accessing it.

Positive Notes:
1. The code is well-structured with proper use of comments and indentation.
2. Use of `std::lock_guard` for mutex locking is a good practice to avoid deadlocks.
3. The use of `std::vector<T>` instead of an array is a good choice as it provides better memory management and thread-safe operations.
4. The use of `std::shared_ptr` instead of raw pointer for the vector is a good practice to avoid memory leaks.

Risk Level:
The changes made to the code do not seem to introduce any significant security vulnerabilities or performance issues. However, it's important to note that the `get()` method throws an exception if the index is out of range, which may be unexpected behavior for some users. Therefore, it would be beneficial to provide proper handling for this scenario.
